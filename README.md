# Monte_carlo_simulation
  * Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation, is a mathematical technique, which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
  * Monte Carlo Simulations for predicting the value of pie. This methods consists of drawing on a canvas a square with an inner circle
  * Then generate a large number of random points within the square and count how many fall in the enclosed circle.

## Implementation 

```
The area of the circle is πr2,
The area of the square is width2 = (2r)2 = 4r2.

If we divide the area of the circle, by the area of the square we get π/4.

The same ratio can be used between the number of points within the square and the number of points within the circle.

Hence we can use the following formula to estimate Pi:

π ≈ 4 x (number of points in the circle / total number of points)```
